        The company was a consortium led by Daimler AG, Deutsche Telekom, and Cofiroute until 2018 when it was taken over by German Government. 
        The consortium won a bid for the development of a toll billing system from the German government. The development of the system started in September 2002. 
        The technology is based on the Global Positioning System, and a web application for booking truck routes in advance. Trucks are equipped with embedded systems called "On Board Units" (OBUs).
        OBUs are used for positioning, monitoring and billing. Additionally, the OBUs have infrared and Dedicated short-range
        communications (DSRC) interfaces for exchanging data with stationary enforcement gantries and mobile enforcement on the tolled road network.
