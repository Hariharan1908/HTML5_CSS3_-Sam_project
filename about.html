                <h3>Services</h3>
                <p>In the year 2016, we started to provide 32 feet multi-axle container trucks for all our logistics needs. These heavy-duty shipping trucks carry heavier loads like machinery, construction materials, bulky goods such as furniture, appliances, food and beverage products, and consumer goods across long distances. The multi-axle helps distribute the weight of the container equally, so it will maintain stable transportation and help to avoid more accidents.</p>
